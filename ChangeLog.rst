* Since glib v2.15, there can now be multiple allocation arenas support for
multi-threaded environments  (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10706466/how-does-malloc-work-in-a-multithreaded-environment).

A new command called "heap arenas" will now allow you to see how many arenas and their respective address locations
