gdb-heap
========

Original fork derived from `https://fedorahosted.org/gdb-heap/`.  This repo is now considered the official repository for the gdb-heap library.

Installation instructions
-------------------------
1. To get this module working with Ubuntu 16.04, make sure you have the following packages installed:

```
sudo apt-get install libc6-dev libc6-dbg python-gi libglib2.0-0-dbg python-ply
```

The original forked version assumes an "import gdb" module, which resides in
"/usr/share/glib-2.0/gdb" as part of the `libglib2.0-0-dbg` package.  Earlier versions
of Ubuntu have this library is located in the `ibglib2.0-dev` package.

There is also a conflict with the python-gobject-2 library, which are deprecated
Python bindings for the GObject library.  This package installs a glib/
directory inside /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/glib/option.py, which many
Gtk-related modules depend.  You will therefore need to make sure the sys.path
for /usr/share/glib-2.0/gdb is declared first for this reason (see code
example).

You'll also want to install python-dbg since the package comes with the
debugging symbols for the stock Python 2.7, as well as a python-dbg binary
compiled with the --with-pydebug option that will only work with C extensions
modules compiled with the /usr/include/python2.7_d headers.

NOTE: The Python binary that accompanies Ubuntu distributions uses link-time
optimization compilation.  As a result, many of the Python data structures are
optimized out and prevent gdb-heap from being able to properly categorize the
various data structures.  To take advantage of this capability, you will need to
download the Python source and recompile without using the -flto option in
the CFLAGS/LDFLAGS configuration option.  Normally this capability is not used in
standard configure so simply compiling it should do the trick.  (If you want
to have SSL support in this binary, make sure to edit Modules/Setup.dist).

The python-dbg binary is compiled with the Py_TRACE_REFS conditional via the
--pydebug which modifies the internal Python data structures and adds two
pointers into every base PyObject, preventing previously compiled C extensions
to be used.  Using your own compiled version of Python is therefore the way to
go if you want to take advantage of the categorize features of gdb-heap and/or
inspecting the internal memory structures of Python.

2. Create a file that will help automate the loading of the gdbheap library:

gdb-heap-commands:

```
python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, "/usr/share/glib-2.0/gdb")
sys.path.append("/usr/share/glib-2.0/gdb")
sys.path.append("/home/rhu/projects/gdb-heap")
import gdbheap
end
```

To attach to an existing process, you can execute as follows:

```bash
sudo gdb -p 7458 -x ~/gdb-heap-commands
```

To take a core dump of a process, you can do the following:

```
1) sudo gdb -p <pid>
2) Type "generate-core-file" at the GDB prompt.
3) Wait awhile (and be careful not to hit enter again, since it will repeat the same command)
4) Copy the core.<pid> file somewhere.
```

You can then use gdb to attach to this core file:

```bash
sudo gdb python <core file> -x ~/gdb-heap-commands
```


Commands to run
---------------

```
heap - print a report on memory usage, by category
heap sizes - print a report on memory usage, by sizes
heap used - print used heap chunks
heap free - print free heap chunks
heap all - print all heap chunks
heap log - print a log of recorded heap states
heap label - record the current state of the heap for later comparison
heap diff - compare two states of the heap
heap select - query used heap chunks
hexdump <addr> [-c] - print a hexdump, stating at the specific region of memory (expose hex characters with -c option)
heap arenas - print glibs arenas
heap arena <arena> - select glibc arena number
heap find -- Find stuff anywhere; supplies ranges to the find command
heap range -- Print all non-empty merged memory ranges sorted by start address
heap range run -- Run a command for each range from `heap range`
```
